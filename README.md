# Brief History

> In Hindu mythology, Tumburu, also known as Tumbaru and Tumbara is the best among Gandharvas or celestial musician and is sometimes described as the best of singers. He is described to perform in the courts of gods Kubera and Indra as well as sing praises of god Vishnu. He leads the Gandharvas in their singing. — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tumburu)

And that's how the project got it's final name, initially it was given a **Project Codename** which later switched from **Smell of the Songs** to **Project A.O.S.** (Aroma of Songs). The idea for this project was originated by encountering [Ashris Choudhury](https://www.media.mit.edu/people/ashris/overview/)'s Project named [Roses in Resonance](https://vimeo.com/150315138) & reinforced by my interest in Applied Mathematics.


# The Lab

To experiment with the numbers and to customise the output rose, this playground was created. It helps one to understand the know-how of this project.
