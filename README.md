# Brief History

I love Music and frankly, who doesn't. From my childhood days, I have this innate tendency of tinkering things for example, from sending songs wirelessly using Light, trying encoding songs visually to making machine generated synthetic songs, somehow Music has always been a center piece to all of it. ‚ÄúAroma of the Songs‚Äù follows this progression and transforms Music into Roses creating exploration space of a unique kind‚Äîthe one that helps you in connecting with Music and impacts you on many levels. Initially it was given the Project Codename S.O.S. meaning Smell of the Songs which then changed (because of the word 'Smell' being a little onto negative side) to Aroma of the Songs or Project A.O.S.

# The Playground

The playground was created to experiment with the numbers, to let users generate roses and play with the project. It helps one to understand the know-how of this project. To know more, you can head over to [Aroma of songs A.K.A. Project A.O.S. In The Making](https://blog.0x48piraj.com/aroma-of-songs-aka-project-aos-in-the-making/). The blog mostly revolves around the overall design process.

# Internal Workings

Algorithm behind this project manoeuvres the cube using a [modified Rose equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)) and [FFT Spectrum Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrum_analyzer#FFT-based).

The proto equations which control the movement of the cube and create intricate realistic looking rose petals are,

```
rotateXorYorZ(cos(A * B)),
rotateXorYorZ(sin(A * B))
```

The cube traces controlled by algorithm's core logic leave behind intricate & beautiful rose petals. The output by the algorithm is integrated with rendering engine called [Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processing_(programming_language)) which handles the movement of the cube.

The source code is in the `/` directory. It is packaged as a Flask application. You can run it by installing Flask and then running the web app by calling,

```
$ python app.py
```
